# Chapter-6
In this chapter, i learned about the most commonly used widgets. These basic widgets are
the building blocks to designing mobile apps. I also explored different types of buttons to choose depending on the situation. I learned how to add assets to your app via AssetBundle by listing items in the pubspec.yaml file. I used the Image widget to load images from the local device or a web server through a URL string. You saw how the Icon widget gives you the ability to load icons by using the MaterialIcons font library.To modify the appearance of widgets, i learned how to use BoxDecoration. To improve giving users feedback on data entry, i also implemented InputDecoration. Validating multiple text field data entries can be cumbersome, but can use the Form widget to manually or automatically validate them. Lastly, using MediaQuery to find out the current device orientation is extremely powerful in any mobile app to lay out widgets depending on the orientation.
